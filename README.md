# âœ¨ React Starter Template ðŸŒ€

## Description
This template is the configuration from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 
with the purpose is to make developers feel more undercontrol and less overload
with less dependencies and smart formater. 

## What's the differences?
- Remove redundant dependencies that small/medium apps may not need.
- Integrate Babel, Eslint and Prettier for better code format. 
- Provide Husky and Lint-staged auto pre-commit format to enhance code consistency.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `yarn format`

Find and format files. You can specify what kinds of files you want to format or exclude any files, etc... in **package.json** scripts.

**Note: When you use `git commit`, [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) will automatically format and fix your code if possible. If it fails to fix it, an error will occur to stop the commit. You can also change the rules of format in `.prettierrc.json` file**.

### `yarn prepare`

This script will run automatically so as to setup [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) when you install or add packages.
